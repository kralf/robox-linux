BUILDING ROBOX LINUX

What is RoboX Linux? 
--------------------

RoboX Linux is a Debian-based Linux distro which cross-compiles for the
PowerPC onboard computer of the RoboX platform. It has been designed for
maximum compatibility at a minimum memory footprint.

How to build this distro? 
-------------------------

First, install ubash and remake from the respective github projects or the
launchpad package repository. Then, you may use the following shell scripts
located under the project root:

  mkxcomp.sh - Make a cross compiling environment
  mkrootfs.sh - Create a root filesystem from scratch
  mkbootrd.sh - Create a boot ramdisk from scratch
  
  or simply
  
  mkrobox-linux.sh - Create robox-linux cross compiling environment and
    boot ramdisk (calls the above scripts in order)

Alternatively, you may want to build the distro for testing in a Xen
virtual machine:
  
  mkxcomp.sh - Make a cross compiling environment
  mkrootfs.sh - Create a root filesystem from scratch
  mkbootfs.sh - Create a boot filesystem from scratch
  
  or simply
  
  mkrobox-linux.xen.sh - Create robox-linux image and boot it in a Xen
    virtual machine (calls the above scripts in order)

The project further provides the following auxiliary scripts:
    
  mkrootfs.debian.sh - Create a Debian root filesystem from scratch
  mountfs.sh - Mount filesystem image
  umountfs.sh - Unmount filesystem image

Note that all package sources are included in this project along with
essential cross-compilation patches and kernel drivers. Additionally, the
project includes the required foreign projects as submodules.
